\label{simulation-workflow} % Note: to create an within-document reference here, use: 'See \href{\#simulation-workflow}{here}'

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sample host tree $\hostTree$.
    \item Sample augmented host tree $\augmentedHostTree$, conditioned on host tree, $\hostTree$.
    \item Extract schedule of events from augmented host tree, $\augmentedHostTree$.
    \item Simulate symbiont tree, $\symbiontTree$, conditioned on schedule of events on host tree.
    \item Scale symbiont tree by each substitution rate scaling factor to yield scaled symbiont tree $\scaledSymbiontTree$.
    \item Calculate summary statistics on scaled symbiont tree, $\scaledSymbiontTree$.
\end{enumerate}
